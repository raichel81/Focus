        "essay": "The pioneers of the teaching of science imagined that its<br>   introduction into education would remove the conventionality,<br>    artificiality, and backward-lookingness which were characteristic;<br>    of classical studies, but they were gravely disappointed. So, too, in<br>   their time had the humanists thought that the study of the classical<br>    authors in the original would banish at once the dull pedantry and<br>    superstition of mediaeval scholasticism. The professional<br>    schoolmaster was a match for both of them, and has almost<br>    managed to make the understanding of chemical reactions as dull<br>10  and as dogmatic an affair as the reading of Virgil's Aeneid.<br><br>    The chief claim for the use of science in education is that it<br>    teaches a child something about the actual universe in which he is<br>    living, in making him acquainted with the results of scientific<br>  discovery, and at the same time teaches him how to think logically<br>    and inductively by studying scientific method. A certain limited<br>    success has been reached in the first of these aims, but practically<br>    none at all in the second. Those privileged members of the<br>    community who have been through a secondary or public school<br>  education may be expected to know something about the<br>    elementary physics and chemistry of a hundred years ago, but they<br>    probably know hardly more than any bright boy can pick up from<br>    an interest in wireless or scientific hobbies out of school hours.<br>  <br>  As to the learning of scientific method, the whole thing is palpably<br>  a farce. Actually, for the convenience of teachers and the<br>    requirements of the examination system, it is necessary that the<br>    pupils not only do not learn scientific method but learn precisely<br>    the reverse, that is, to believe exactly what they are told and to<br>    reproduce it when asked, whether it seems nonsense to them or<br>  not. The way in which educated people respond to such quackeries<br>    as spiritualism or astrology, not to say more dangerous ones such<br>    as racial theories or currency myths, shows that fifty years of<br>    education in the method of science in Britain or Germany has<br>    produced no visible effect whatever. The only way of learning the<br>35  method of science is the long and bitter way of personal<br>    experience, and, until the educational or social systems are altered<br>    to make this possible, the best we can expect is the production of a<br>    minority of people who are able to acquire some of the techniques<br>    of science and a still smaller minority who are able to use and<br>  develop them.<br><br>Adapted from: The Social Function of Science, John D Bernal (1939)",

        "essay": "By the time a child is six or seven she has all the essential <br>    avoidances well enough by heart to be trusted with the care of a <br>    younger child. And she also develops a number of simple <br>    techniques. She learns to weave firm square balls from palm <br>   leaves, to make pinwheels of palm leaves or frangipani blossoms, <br>    to climb a coconut tree by walking up the trunk on flexible little <br>    feet, to break open a coconut with one firm well-directed blow of <br>    a knife as long as she is tall, to play a number of group games <br>    and sing the songs which go with them, to tidy the house by <br>10  picking up the litter on the stony floor, to bring water from the <br>    sea, to spread out the copra to dry and to help gather it in when <br>    rain threatens, to go to a neighboring house and bring back a <br>    lighted faggot for the chief's pipe or the cook-house fire.<br><br>      But in the case of the little girls all these tasks are merely <br>  supplementary to the main business of baby-tending. Very small <br>    boys also have some care of the younger children, but at eight or <br>    nine years of age they are usually relieved of it. Whatever rough <br>    edges have not been smoothed off by this responsibility for <br>    younger children are worn off by their contact with older boys. <br>  For little boys are admitted to interesting and important activities <br>    only so long as their behavior is circumspect and helpful. Where <br>    small girls are brusquely pushed aside, small boys will be <br>    patiently tolerated and they become adept at making themselves <br>    useful. The four or five little boys who all wish to assist at the <br>  important, business of helping a grown youth lasso reef eels, <br>    organize themselves into a highly efficient working team; one boy <br>    holds the bait, another holds an extra lasso, others poke <br>    eagerly about in holes in the reef looking for prey, while still <br>    another tucks the captured eels into his lavalava. The small girls, <br>  burdened with heavy babies or the care of little staggerers who are <br>    too small to adventure on the reef, discouraged by the hostility <br>    of the small boys and the scorn of the older ones, have <br>    little opportunity for learning the more adventurous forms of work <br>    and play. So while the little boys first undergo the <br>  chastening effects of baby-tending and then have many <br>    opportunities to learn effective cooperation under the supervision <br>    of older boys, the girls' education is less comprehensive. They <br>    have a high standard of individual responsibility, but the <br>    community provides them with no lessons in cooperation with one <br>  another. This is particularly apparent in the activities of young <br>    people: the boys organize quickly; the girls waste hours in <br>    bickering, innocent of any technique for quick and efficient <br>    cooperation.<br><br>Adapted from: Coming of Age in Samoa, Margaret Mead (1928)",

        "essay": "The name of Florence Nightingale lives in the memory of the <br>    world by virtue of the heroic adventure of the Crimea. Had she <br>    died - as she nearly did - upon her return to England, her <br>    reputation would hardly have been different; her legend would <br>   have come down to us almost as we know it today - that gentle <br>    vision of female virtue which first took shape before the adoring <br>    eyes of the sick soldiers at Scutari. Yet, as a matter of fact, she <br>    lived for more than half a century after the Crimean War; and <br>    during the greater part of that long period all the energy and all the <br>10  devotion of her extraordinary nature were working at their <br>    highest pitch. What she accomplished in those years of unknown <br>    labor could, indeed, hardly have been more glorious than her <br>    Crimean triumphs; but it was certainly more important. The true <br>    history was far stranger even than the myth. In Miss Nightingale's <br>  own eyes the adventure of the Crimea was a mere incident - <br>    scarcely more than a useful stepping-stone in her career. It was the <br>    fulcrum with which she hoped to move the world; but it was <br>    only the fulcrum. For more than a generation she was to sit in <br>    secret, working her lever: and her real life began at the very <br>  moment when, in popular imagination, it had ended.<br><br>    She arrived in England in a shattered state of health. The <br>    hardships and the ceaseless efforts of the last two years had <br>    undermined her nervous system; her heart was affected; she <br>    suffered constantly from fainting-fits and terrible attacks of utter <br>  physical prostration. The doctors declared that one thing alone <br>    would save her - a complete and prolonged rest. But that was also <br>    the one thing with which she would have nothing to do. She had <br>    never been in the habit of resting; why should she begin now? <br>    Now, when her opportunity had come at last; now, when the iron <br>  was hot, and it was time to strike? No; she had work to do; and, <br>    come what might, she would do it. The doctors protested in vain; <br>    in vain her family lamented and entreated, in vain her friends <br>    pointed out to her the madness of such a course. Madness? Mad - <br>    possessed - perhaps she was. A frenzy had seized upon her. As <br>  she lay upon her sofa, gasping, she devoured blue-books, dictated <br>    letters, and, in the intervals of her palpitations, cracked jokes. For <br>    months at a stretch she never left her bed. But she would not rest. <br>    At this rate, the doctors assured her, even if she did not die, she <br>    would become an invalid for life. She could not help that; there <br>  was work to be done; and, as for rest, very likely she might rest ... <br>    when she had done it.<br><br>    Wherever she went, to London or in the country, in the hills <br>    of Derbyshire, or among the rhododendrons at Embley, she was <br>    haunted by a ghost. It was the specter of Scutari - the hideous <br>  vision of the organization of a military hospital. She would lay that <br>    phantom, or she would perish. The whole system of the <br>    Army Medical Department, the education of the Medical Officer, <br>    the regulations of hospital procedure ... rest? How could she rest <br>    while these things were as they were, while, if the like necessity <br>0  were to arise again, the like results would follow? And, even in <br>    peace and at home, what was the sanitary condition of the Army? <br>    The mortality in the barracks, was, she found, nearly double the <br>    mortality in civil life. 'You might as well take 1, 100 men every <br>    year out upon Salisbury Plain and shoot them,' she said. After <br>  inspecting the hospitals at Chatham, she smiled grimly. 'Yes, this <br>    is one more symptom of the system which, in the Crimea, put to <br>    death 16,000 men.' Scutari had given her knowledge; and it had <br>    given her power too: her enormous reputation was at her back - <br>    an incalculable force. Other work, other duties, might lie before <br>  her; but the most urgent, the most obvious, of all was to look to <br>    the health of the Army.<br><br>Adapted from: Eminent Victorians, Lytton Strachey (1918)<br>",

        "essay": "I have yet to meet a poetry-lover under thirty who was<br>    not an introvert, or an introvert who was not unhappy in<br>    adolescence. At school, particularly, maybe, if, as in my own<br>    case, it is a boarding school, he sees the extrovert successful, <br>   happy, and good and himself unpopular or neglected; and what is<br>    hardest to bear is not unpopularity, but the consciousness that it<br>    is deserved, that he is grubby and inferior and frightened and<br>    dull. Knowing no other kind of society than the contingent, he<br>    imagines that this arrangement is part of the eternal scheme of <br>10  things, that he is doomed to a life of failure and envy. It is not till<br>    he grows up, till years later he runs across the heroes of his<br>    school days and finds them grown commonplace and sterile, that<br>    he realizes that the introvert is the lucky one, the best adapted to<br>    an industrial civilization the collective values of which are so <br>  infantile that he alone can grow, who has educated his fantasies<br>    and learned how to draw upon the resources of his inner life. At<br>    the time, however, his adolescence is unpleasant enough. Unable<br>    to imagine a society in which he would feel at home, he turns<br>    away from the human to the nonhuman: homesick he will seek, <br>  not his mother, but mountains or autumn woods, and the<br>    growing life within him will express itself in a devotion to music<br>    and thoughts upon mutability and death. Art for him will be<br>    something infinitely precious, pessimistic, and hostile to life. If it<br>    speaks of love it must be love frustrated, for all success seems to <br>  him noisy and vulgar; if it moralizes, it must counsel a stoic<br>    resignation, for the world he knows is well content with itself and<br>    will not change.<br><br>Deep as first love and wild with all regret,<br>O death in life, the days that are no more.<br><br>Now more than ever seems it sweet to die<br>To cease upon the midnight with no pain.<br><br>  That to the adolescent is the authentic poetic note and whoever is<br>    the first in his life to strike it, whether Tennyson, Keats,<br>    Swinburne, Housman or another, awakens a passion of imitation<br>    and an affectation which no subsequent refinement or<br>    sophistication of his taste can entirely destroy. In my own case it <br>  was Hardy in the summer of 1923; for more than a year I read no<br>    one else and I do not think that I was ever without one volume or<br>    another or the beautifully produced Wessex edition in my hands:<br>    I smuggled them into class, carried them about on Sunday walks,<br>    and took them up to the dormitory to read in the early morning, <br>  though they were far too unwieldy to be read in bed with<br>    comfort. In the autumn of 1924 there was a palace revolution<br>    after which he had to share his kingdom with Edward Thomas,<br>    until finally they were both defeated by Elliot at the battle of<br>    Oxford in 1926.<br> <br> Besides serving as the archetype of the Poetic, Hardy was<br>    also an expression of the contemporary scene. He was both my<br>    Keats and my Sandburg.<br> <br>   To begin with, he looked like my father: that broad<br>    unpampered moustache, bald forehead, and deeply lined <br>  sympathetic face belonged to that other world of feeling and<br>    sensation. Here was a writer whose emotions, if sometimes<br>    monotonous and sentimental in expression, would be deeper and<br>    more faithful than my own, and whose attachment to the earth<br>    would be more secure and observant.<br><br>Adapted from an article written by W H Auden",
