		<div class="essay"> 
				The pioneers of the teaching of science imagined that its
			    introduction into education would remove the conventionality,
			    artificiality, and backward-lookingness which were characteristic;
			    of classical studies, but they were gravely disappointed. So, too, in
			5   their time had the humanists thought that the study of the classical
			    authors in the original would banish at once the dull pedantry and
			    superstition of mediaeval scholasticism. The professional
			    schoolmaster was a match for both of them, and has almost
			    managed to make the understanding of chemical reactions as dull
			10  and as dogmatic an affair as the reading of Virgil's Aeneid.
