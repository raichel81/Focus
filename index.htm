Whoever buzzes first will have 3 seconds to answer the question. If the answer is correct that player gets 1 point BUT if it is wrong you lose 1 point. If the player doesn't answer within 3 seconds the other player gets 3 seconds to answer. If both players fail to answer the question YOU BOTH LOSE 1 POINT!

				The pioneers of the teaching of science imagined that its
			    introduction into education would remove the conventionality,
			    artificiality, and backward-lookingness which were characteristic;
			    of classical studies, but they were gravely disappointed. So, too, in
			5   their time had the humanists thought that the study of the classical
			    authors in the original would banish at once the dull pedantry and
			    superstition of mediaeval scholasticism. The professional
			    schoolmaster was a match for both of them, and has almost
			    managed to make the understanding of chemical reactions as dull
			10  and as dogmatic an affair as the reading of Virgil's Aeneid.

			    The chief claim for the use of science in education is that it
			    teaches a child something about the actual universe in which he is
			    living, in making him acquainted with the results of scientific
			15  discovery, and at the same time teaches him how to think logically
			    and inductively by studying scientific method. A certain limited
			    success has been reached in the first of these aims, but practically
			    none at all in the second. Those privileged members of the
			    community who have been through a secondary or public school
			20  education may be expected to know something about the
			    elementary physics and chemistry of a hundred years ago, but they
			    probably know hardly more than any bright boy can pick up from
			    an interest in wireless or scientific hobbies out of school hours.
			    As to the learning of scientific method, the whole thing is palpably
			25  a farce. Actually, for the convenience of teachers and the
			    requirements of the examination system, it is necessary that the
			    pupils not only do not learn scientific method but learn precisely
			    the reverse, that is, to believe exactly what they are told and to
			    reproduce it when asked, whether it seems nonsense to them or
			30  not. The way in which educated people respond to such quackeries
			    as spiritualism or astrology, not to say more dangerous ones such
			    as racial theories or currency myths, shows that fifty years of
			    education in the method of science in Britain or Germany has
			    produced no visible effect whatever. The only way of learning the
			35  method of science is the long and bitter way of personal
			    experience, and, until the educational or social systems are altered
			    to make this possible, the best we can expect is the production of a
			    minority of people who are able to acquire some of the techniques
			    of science and a still smaller minority who are able to use and
			40  develop them.
